# About us
We don’t just offer insurance. We create solutions tailored to needs.

Founded in 2015, dentolo builds and operates holistic insurance solutions, radically centered around you. We believe in offering a solution for everyone’s individual needs, so that they and their loved ones can be more carefree. Our solutions are built through conversations with our customers, teams and market specialists. We call this our expert insurance approach.

Today, every fourth new online customer in Germany chooses us as their partner for dental and pet health insurance. Our first two brands, dentolo and petolo, are rated 4.5+ of 5 on Google - unlike any other provider. We are customer-obsessed experts who love working together as a team. Our culture is built on collaboration, fast execution and bold actions, always caring about the customer first.
